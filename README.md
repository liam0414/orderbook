# Financial Order Book Engine

A high-performance C++20 implementation of a financial order book system with price-time priority matching, designed for low-latency trading applications.

## 🚀 Key Items

### **Performance & Architecture**
- **Optimized Data Structures**: Uses `std::map` with custom comparators for O(log n) price level operations
- **Fast Order Lookup**: Hash-based order tracking with `std::unordered_map` for O(1) cancellations
- **Memory Efficient**: Smart pointer-based order management with automatic cleanup
- **Sub-microsecond Queries**: Market data queries averaging <1000 nanoseconds per operation

### **Advanced Matching Engine**
- **Price-Time Priority**: Strict FIFO matching within price levels, industry-standard algorithm
- **Multi-Level Execution**: Supports crossing multiple price levels in a single transaction
- **Market & Limit Orders**: Full support for both order types with proper validation
- **Partial Fill Handling**: Sophisticated order state management with quantity tracking

## Performance Metrics
- **Order Addition**: <10 microseconds per order (average)
- **Market Data Queries**: <1000 nanoseconds per query
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for minimal allocation overhead
- **Concurrency**: Safe multi-reader, single-writer access patterns

### Core Trading Operations
- ✅ **Add Limit Orders** - Price-time priority placement
- ✅ **Add Market Orders** - Immediate execution against best prices  
- ✅ **Order Cancellation** - Fast O(1) lookup and removal
- ✅ **Partial Fills** - Automatic quantity and state management

### Market Data & Analytics
- ✅ **Best Bid/Ask** - Real-time top-of-book data
- ✅ **Bid-Ask Spread** - Instant spread calculations
- ✅ **Market Depth** - Multi-level order book depth queries
- ✅ **Trade Statistics** - Volume, trade count, and execution tracking

### Advanced Capabilities
- ✅ **Multi-Level Matching** - Orders can cross multiple price levels
- ✅ **Thread-Safe Queries** - Concurrent read access for market data
- ✅ **Order Book Visualization** - Built-in pretty printing
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in benchmarking tools

## Architecture

OrderBook
├── Price Levels (std::map)
│   ├── Bids (descending order)
│   └── Asks (ascending order)
├── Order Management (std::unordered_map)
├── Trade Execution Engine
└── Thread-Safe Market Data
```

**Key Components:**
- `Order`: Smart order state management with fill tracking
- `PriceLevel`: FIFO queue for time priority at each price
- `Trade`: Immutable trade records with full audit trail
- `OrderBook`: Main engine coordinating all operations

## 🚧 Known Issues & Roadmap

### **Current Limitations**
- **Concurrency Bottleneck**: Single-writer lock may limit throughput under heavy write loads
- **Memory Growth**: No automatic cleanup of empty price levels in some edge cases
- **Limited Order Types**: Only supports Market and Limit orders (no Stop, IOC, FOK, etc.)

### **Planned Improvements**
- [ ] **Lock-Free Design**: Implement lock-free data structures for higher throughput
- [ ] **Advanced Order Types**: Add Stop-Loss, Immediate-or-Cancel, Fill-or-Kill orders
- [ ] **Market Data Streaming**: Real-time event notifications for price/depth changes
- [ ] **Persistence Layer**: Add order book state serialization/recovery
- [ ] **Metrics Integration**: Built-in performance monitoring and alerting

## 🛠️ Building & Testing

### **Prerequisites**
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.10+
- Catch2 (included)

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Build the project
cmake -B build
cd build  
make

# Run comprehensive tests
ctest --verbose

# Try the interactive demo
./client
```

### **Development Build**
```bash
# Debug build with sanitizers
cmake -B build
cd build
make

# Run benchmarks  
./client
```

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Order Management
```cpp
OrderBook book;

// Add limit orders
auto buy_id = book.add_order(99.50, 1000, Side::BUY);
auto sell_id = book.add_order(100.25, 500, Side::SELL);

// Execute market order (crosses spread)
auto trades = book.add_market_order(750, Side::BUY);

// Query market data
auto best_bid = book.get_best_bid();    // Optional<double>
auto best_ask = book.get_best_ask();    // Optional<double>  
auto spread = book.get_spread();        // Optional<double>

// Check depth at different levels
auto depth_l1 = book.get_bid_depth_at_level(0);  // Top level
auto depth_l2 = book.get_bid_depth_at_level(1);  // Second level
```

### Advanced Features
```cpp
// Cancel orders
bool cancelled = book.cancel_order(buy_id);

// Get comprehensive statistics
auto total_orders = book.get_total_orders();
auto total_volume = book.get_total_volume();
auto trade_count = book.get_total_trades();

// Visualize the order book
book.print_book(5);  // Show top 5 levels
```
